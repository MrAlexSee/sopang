## Basic information

This software is called **SOPanG** (Shift-Or for Pan-Genome). It can be used for matching patterns in elastic-degenerate (ED) text (simplified pan-genome model). Authors: Aleksander Cisłak, Szymon Grabowski, Jan Holub.

Published as an applications note entitled *SOPanG: online text searching over a pan-genome* (Cisłak, Grabowski, Holub), Bioinformatics, Vol. 34, Issue 24, 12/2018, pp. 4290-4292.

ED text is in a format possibly best explained with an example: `{A,C,}GAAT{AT,A}ATT`. 
Braces determine the start and end of each non-deterministic segment (a segment having multiple variants), and commas delimit segment variants.
If a comma is not preceded by a string of letters or it is a trailing symbol in a segment, it indicates an empty word.
To give an example, all three notations: `{,A,C}`, `{A,,C}`, and `{A,C,}` mean the same, which is a segment which accepts either a string `A`, or a string `C`, or an empty word.
Deterministic segments (i.e. segments having a single variant) are stored as regular contiguous strings.
Note that, e.g., `{AC,CG}` and `{AC, CG}` are not the same (the latter would expect a space in its second variant).
Therefore, you should not use whitespaces in the ED text if not intended.

SOPanG returns the end positions of pattern occurrences in the ED text. More precisely, it returns the set of segment indexes in which pattern occurrences end (without possible duplicates).

## Compilation

Add Boost library to the path for compilation by setting `BOOST_DIR` in the makefile. 
Requires Boost program options module to be compiled for static linking.
Requires support for the C++11 standard.

Type `make` for optimized compile.
Comment out `OPTFLAGS` in the makefile in order to disable optimization.

Tested with gcc 64-bit 7.2.0 and Boost 1.67.0 (the latter is not performance-critical, used only for parameter and data parsing and formatting) on Ubuntu 17.10 Linux version 4.13.0-36 64-bit.

A binary (compiled executable) for Linux is available in the release (file name `sopang`).

## Usage

Basic usage: `./sopang [options] <input text file> <input pattern file>`

Input text file (positional parameter 1 or named parameter `-i` or `--in-text-file`) should contain the elastic-degenerate text in the format `{A,C,}GAAT{AT,A}ATT`.
Input pattern file (positional parameter 2 or named parameter `-I` or `--in-pattern-file`) should contain the list of patterns, each of the same length, separated with newline characters.
Attached as part of this package is a script `run_all.sh`, which allows for processing multiple input text (chromosome) and pattern files.

* End-to-end tests are located in the `end_to_end_tests` folder and they can be run using the `run_tests.sh` script in that folder.

* Performance testing tools are located in the `performance_tests` folder, see below for details.

* Python tools are located in the `scripts` folder, see below for details.

* Unit tests are located in the `unit_tests` folder and they can be run by issuing the `make run` command in that folder.

&nbsp;     | `--help-verbose`        | display verbose help message
`-i`       | `--in-text-file arg`    | input text file path (positional arg 1)

## Compile-time parameter description

#### params.hpp

Parameter name  | Parameter description
--------------- | ---------------------
`alphabet`      | a set of symbols occurring in input (ED) text file or input pattern file

#### sopang.hpp

Parameter name   | Parameter description
---------------- | ---------------------
`dBufferSize`    | buffer size for processing segment variants, the size of the largest segment (i.e. the number of variants) from the input file cannot be larger than this value
`maskBufferSize` | buffer size for Shift-Or masks for the input alphabet, must be larger than the largest input character ASCII code
`wordSize`       | word size (in bits) used by the Shift-Or algorithm

## Testing

Testing can be automated with the use of scripts from the `performance_tests` folder.

Script name                     | Description
------------------------------- | ------------------------------
`generate_real_source_data.sh`  | Generates ED-text and source files for the reference .fasta file and a set .vcf variant files.
`generate_synthetic_data.sh`    | Generates synthetic ED-text and source files for various output file sizes.
`run_all.sh`                    | Performs experiments for regular ED-text matching and ED-text matching with sources.

A complete testing procedure is as follows.

1. Run `generate_synthetic_data.sh`.

1. Download data from the 1000 Genomes project: [FTP server](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/).

1. Move the reference `hs37d5.fa` file to the `data` folder. Move all .vcf files to the `data` folder, rename them as `chr1.vcf`, `chr2.vcf`, ..., `chr24.vcf`.

1. Run `generate_real_source_data.sh`. For all chromosomes, this will take a very, very long time (days), however, it only needs to be performed once in order to obtain elastic-degenerate data with sources.

1. Compile SoPanG (see above).

1. Run `run_all.sh`.

## Scripts

All Python (Python 3, tested with Python 3.6.8) scripts are located in the `scripts` folder. Their command line parameters are described as docopt interfaces at the top of each file.

Script name                         | Description
----------------------------------- | ------------------------------
`ed_histogram.py`                   | Prints the histogram of character counts in deterministic/non-deterministic segments.
`generate_synth_ed_text.py`         | Generates synthetic elastic-degenerate text.
`generate_synth_sources.py`         | Generates a synthetic sources file for elastic-degenerate text.
`parse_fasta_vcf_to_ed_sources.py`  | Parses a .fasta and .vcf file pair in order to obtain elastic-degenerate text with sources.
