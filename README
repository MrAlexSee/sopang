This software is called SOPanG (Shift-Or for Pan-Genome). It can be used for matching patterns in elastic-degenerate (ED) text (simplified pangenome model).

ED text is in a format: {A,C,}GAAT{AT,A}ATT. Braces determine the start and end of each indeterminate segment (i.e. segment having multiple variants), and commas delimit segment variants. Determinate segments (i.e. segments having a single variant) are stored as regular contiguous strings.

SOPanG returns the end positions of pattern occurrences in the ED text.
More precisely, it returns the set of segment indexes in which pattern occurrences end (without possible duplicates).

### To compile:

Add Boost library to the path for compilation.

Regular compile: g++ -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 main.cpp sopang.cpp -o sopang
Optimized compile: g++ -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11 -DNDEBUG -O3 main.cpp sopang.cpp -o sopang
Or set BOOST_DIR in makefile and type "make" for optimized compile.

Tested with gcc 64-bit 7.2.0 and Boost 1.65.1 on Ubuntu 17.10 Linux version 4.13.0-36 64-bit.

### To use:

1. Download edso: https://github.com/webmasterar/edso/.

2. Download data from the 1000 Genomes project: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/.

3. Run edso for each chromosome and variants file. Rename resulting files as chr1.eds, chr2.eds, ..., chr23.eds.

4. Generate synthetic data by running python generate synth.py (requires Python 2.7) 4 times for the number of segments (parameter nSegments) set to 100, 500, 1000, and 1600. Rename files as chr24.eds, chr25.eds, chr26.eds, chr27.eds.

5. Set parameter inDataFolder to the folder containing .eds files and pattern files (all pattern files are located in the sample/ folder as part of this package).

6. Compile SoPanG (see above).

7. Run python run_all.sh.
