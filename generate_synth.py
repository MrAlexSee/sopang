Grossi et al., On-line pattern matching on similar texts, CPM'17

page 11:
Synthetic data. Synthetic ED texts were created randomly (uniform distribution over
the DNA alphabet) with n ranging from 100,000 to 1,600,000; and the percentage of
degenerate positions was set to 10%. For each degenerate position within the synthetic ED
texts, the number of strings was chosen randomly, with an upper bound set to 10. The
length of each string of a degenerate position was chosen randomly, with an upper bound
again set to 10. Every non-degenerate position within the synthetic ED texts contained a
single letter. Four different patterns of length m = 8, 16, 32, or 64 were given as input to all
three programs, along with the aforementioned synthetic ED texts, resulting in four sets of
output.
